**Reinforcement Learning (RL) vs Supervised Learning**

*   **Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where an agent learns from labeled data, i.e., input-output pairs. The goal is to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.
    *   Examples:
        1.  Image classification
        2.  Sentiment analysis
        3.  Regression tasks
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.
    *   Examples:
        1.  Playing video games (e.g., AlphaGo)
        2.  Robotics control
        3.  Recommendation systems

Key differences:

*   **Learning objective**: Supervised learning focuses on minimizing the difference between predicted and actual outputs, whereas RL aims to maximize cumulative rewards or minimize penalties.
*   **Data requirements**: Supervised learning requires labeled data, while RL can operate with unlabeled data.
*   **Interaction with environment**: RL involves direct interaction with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
